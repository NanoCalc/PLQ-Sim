**Photoluminescence Quenching Simulator (`PLQ-Sim`)** is a user-friendly software to study the photoexcited state dynamics at the interface between two organic semiconductors forming a blend, an electron donor (D), and an electron acceptor (A). Its main function is to provide substantial information on the photophysical processes relevant to organic photovoltaic and photothermal devices, such as charge transfer state formation and subsequent free charge generation or exciton recombination.

The PL effect corresponds to the light emission from the radiative exciton recombination after photon absorption in the material. Depending on the material combination, PL can be quenched due to interfacial charge transfer processes.

If the excitation wavelength corresponds to donor’s main absorption band, the PL quenching efficiency of the donor excitonic luminescence ($PLQ_{D}$) is given by:

$$ PLQ_{D}(\\%) = 1 - \dfrac{PL\left[D/A\right]}{PL\left[D\right]} $$

If the excitation wavelength corresponds to acceptor’s main absorption band, the PL quenching efficiency of the acceptor excitonic luminescence ($PLQ_{A}$) is given by:

$$ PLQ_{A}(\\%) = 1 - \dfrac{PL\left[D/A\right]}{PL\left[A\right]} $$
